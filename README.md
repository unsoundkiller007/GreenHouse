# GreenHouse-A-Social-Blog-app- | 
This is GreenHouse, a Blog app made by me using Java .

I used android studio as IDE for making this app...

Firebase is used as the key server and for the data storage of the user posts...

1. Here we can post pictures in the blog

2. Used Otp verification during Signup process

3. Users can like and comment on the posts

3. Profiles can be customised whenever needed

4. Password reset can also be performed in case you forget the password

Feel free to use this application and do report me the bugs if you find one , accordingly I will accept fork requests ✌🏻

Incase anyone wants to test the application do clone from this Repository 👍🏻
